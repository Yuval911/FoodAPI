<h3>Food API</h3>

(This project was built and tested in .NET Framework 4.6.1)

This is a demo of a basic Web API and a client.

This project has 4 parts:

<ul>
  <li><b>ASP .NET Web API:</b> This is a RESTfull API. It bridges between the data model and the oustide world, allowing the users to access it. </li>
  <li><b>C# Class Library:</b> A library that includes the model and the data access class. The connection to the database is made with Entity Framework. </li>
  <li><b>SQL Database (not included):</b> Contains only one table, in order to keep it simple. </li>
  <li><b>Console Client:</b> The client demonstrates sending serveral basic http requests to the Web API. </li>
</ul>

This is a small project and it contains only one object which is a <b>food</b>.

To run this project you will need to create a SQL Database with this one table:

This is a nice introduction to ASP .NET Web API.

I hope you will find this repository valuable for you.
